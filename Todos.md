## NOW
+ Set cart parts invincible too (app.Gm80_042.PartsList[], app.Sm80_042_Parts.CompHit.IsInvincible)
+ BUG: Game loads same oxcart & guards
    + Find a way to refresh the cart. Finding this should enable me to also allow cart configuration
+ BUG: Wandering too far from cart makes cart fall apart & disappear
    + Making the cart truly invincible & unbroken should resolve this

## SOON
+ Faster ox
+ Guard buffs (advanced abilities, buffed stats)
+ User configurability
 
## LATER
+ Driver behavior alteration (join fights, add player classes/abilities)
+ Driver appearance alteration (glowing eyes in combat, see about using the Medusa glare for this)
+ Driver BGM (nuDoom music plays when drivers get into fight)
+ Option - much faster cart outside of combat, play yakety sax
 
### DONE
+ "set invincible" logic to its own function
